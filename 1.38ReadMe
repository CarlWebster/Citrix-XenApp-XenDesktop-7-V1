#Version 1.38 9-Oct-2017
#	From version 1.33:
#		Added sort applications by AdminFolderName and ApplicationName to Function ProcessApplications (Thanks to Brandon Mitchell)
#		This is only valid for XenApp/XenDesktop version 7.6 and later
#		Use (Get-BrokerServiceAddedCapability) -contains "ApplicationFolders" to determine version info
#		For XA/XD versions before 7.6, sort applications by Name property only
#		For versions 7.0 thru 7.5, use the Name property for output, 7.6+ use ApplicationName
